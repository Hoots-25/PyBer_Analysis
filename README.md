# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
In this project, PyBer ride-sharing data was analyzed by city type in order to understand and visualize differences. The first part of this assignment was to create a new dataframe that shows a summary as a function of city type.

In the second part of the assignment, data was selected for a time span from January through April of 2019. A line graph was created to illustrate the total fare over a period of time for each city type (rural, suburban, & urban).

## Results

The Pyber summary by city type can be [found here](Analysis/ride_summary_by_city.png). There are more drivers in urban cities, and because of that, the average fare per driver and per ride are less than suburban and urban cities. Urban city's total fare was $39,854.38, followed by $19,356.33 in suburban cities and $4,327.93 for rural cities.

For the second part of the PyBer assignment, the plot can be [seen here](Analysis/PyBer_Fare_Summary.png). As expected, the urban region dominates in overall fares over time with Suburban and rural city types coming  in second and third respectoively. Each region saw a spike in total fare in the latter half of February. There may have been an uptick in travel due to holidays.

## Summary

Overall, there are little disparities seen in the data. Urban cities provide the most profit and amount of rides relative to suburban and rural cities. It may be beneficial to promote or advertise new drivers in suburban and rural cities. This would help close the gap of average fare per driver. The average fare per ride is higher in the rural areas. This is also attributed to an overall lower number of rides and drivers.
